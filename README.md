# E05a-Animation

We will begin to explore keyboard and mouse control in a Python Arcade program.
I have uploaded this link [http://arcade.academy/examples/move_mouse.html#move-mouse](http://arcade.academy/examples/move_mouse.html#move-mouse) to main1.py and have added comments to the code based on what i felt i understood and did not understand. There was nothing I did not understand in main1.py. Similarly, I did the same for main2.py. The code was pretty starightforward and understandable.


I created a new file and titled it main3.py and in this file with the code from this link 
[http://arcade.academy/examples/sprite_move_animation.html#sprite-move-animation](http://arcade.academy/examples/sprite_move_animation.html#sprite-move-animation)  I downlaoded sprite assets for the player and coins and from a website. I then placed them in image folders according to the code. I then made sure the chracters could move left and right, up and down and "consume" the coins. The couns are a bit large however it still works in the game. Seeing the code work is very gratifying.
